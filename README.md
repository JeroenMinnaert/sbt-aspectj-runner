sbt-aspectj-runner   [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kamon-io/sbt-aspectj-runner.png)](https://travis-ci.org/kamon-io/sbt-aspectj-runner)
=========

This project contains two [sbt] plugins to perform [Load-time weaving] \(LTW\) with Aspectj in a fast and easy way in our sbt projects and also we will be able to do a [run in development mode] in [play] based projects and everything will be fine. In order to run those plugins will we require sbt **0.13.x**.


##Sbt Projects

###Configure

Add the `aspectj-runner` plugin to `project/plugins.sbt`. It should looks like this:

```scala

addSbtPlugin("io.kamon" % "aspectj-runner" % "0.1.0")

```
###Run

To run your application with `LTW` support, the only thing that we need is call to `run` or `run-main` task. This uses the same underlying settings for the regular run tasks, and also add the configuration needed to instrument your application, depending if the task needs `fork` or not.

To run the default or discovered main class use:

```scala

aspectj-runner:run

```

To run a specific main class:

```scala

aspectj-runner:run-main my.awesome.package.MainClass

```

Additionally we can run the tests with LTW. For that we need include the test specific settings in our build:

```scala

kamon.aspectj.sbt.AspectjRunner.testSettings

```
and finally

```scala

aspectj-runner-test:run

```

We have two sceneries:
* **fork in run := true**: In this case, the forked process will run with the `-javaagent:<jarpath>` and that is all.
* **fork in run := false**: Here we will load the application with a custom classloader called [WeavingURLClassLoader] that allow instantiate a weaver and weave classes after loading and before defining them in the JVM. This enables load-time weaving to be supported in environments where no weaving agent is available.


##Play Projects
When we try run a Play application with LTW we will find with some issues:

* Play has a `dynamic class-loading` mechanism that loads dependency classes differently then it
does the classes in your source code in order to be able to reload changes in dev mode, this breaks some [Load-time Weaving Requirements].
* Also by design Play doesn't and can not fork, hence setting `javaOptions` has no effect.
* In the case that we be able in some way fork Play run to attach the `-javaagent:<jarpath>`, we'll lose the dev mode reloading.


Having said that, **letâ€™s get into the rabbit hole!**.

In order to achieve the LTW support in  Play's dev run, we will use the same approach used in the `Activator Inspect` and `sbt-echo`, and we heavily inspired in the last one.

**The basic idea is**: configure a custom classloader, in our case  it will be the [WeavingURLClassLoader] rather than a java agent. (and Play run will set up to allow the class loader to be configured). The magic is [here].

###Configure

Add the `aspectj-play-runner` plugin to `project/plugins.sbt`. It should looks like this:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("io.kamon" % "aspectj-play-runner" % "0.1.0")

```

the code above is for **Play 2.4.x**, in the case of **Play 2.3.x**, It should looks like this:

```scala

addSbtPlugin("io.kamon" % "aspectj-play-23-runner" % "0.1.0")

```

###Run

```scala

aspectj-play-runner:run

```
###Enjoy!

##Examples

There are full [runnable examples][examples].
